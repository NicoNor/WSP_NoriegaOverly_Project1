		<p>My PC is my life. I use it everyday for extended periods of time because it is my source of information and entertainment. I got into
			 web design and development because my friends told me to give it a go. I began with Code Academy and w3schools which made me want to pursue
			 this as a profession. I love the challenge coding brings and those little mess ups that make you waste an entire day yet feel so rewarding so fix
			 (even though it might just be a missing semi-colon).

			<h2>Drop-down Navigation</h2>

			<h3>What I hope to practice/learn:</h3>
				<p>Drop-down navigation headings can be really annoying to deal with. I can usually get everything to work, but once I start add styles everything starts to mess up.
					 I want to practice and learn how to efficiently code my nav bars so that I am able to efficiently play with the style and not mess up its functionality.
					 </p>

			<h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
				<p>In our previous class, we learned how to use Jquery to make drop down navs in our websites. In WDD nav bars are very important because they are the way people
					get around your website. This component is used is almost every website and is a key component to know how to build.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><span>1</span>Navigation <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> containing a <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> with four <code>&#60;li&#62;</code>, each containing an <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;img&#62;</code>.</li>
					<li><span>2</span>Company branding established by <code>&#60;img&#62; or <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> element with styling.</code></li>
					<li><span>3</span>Drop-down menu items will be nested <code>&#60;ul&#62;</code> inside of corresponding <code>&#60;li&#62;</code></li>
					<li></li>
					<li></li>
				</ol>
